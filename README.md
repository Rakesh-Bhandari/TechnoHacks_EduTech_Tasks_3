### Palindrome Checker in C

This simple C program checks if a given string is a palindrome. It compares characters from the start and end of the string, moving inward, to verify whether the string reads the same forwards and backwards. 

### Features:
- Takes a string as input and checks if it's a palindrome.
- Efficient character-by-character comparison with minimal memory usage.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository or download the `palindrome_checker.c` file.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler, e.g., `gcc palindrome_checker.c -o palindrome_checker`.
3. Run the program, enter a string when prompted, and the program will tell you if it is a palindrome.

### Example:
```
Enter the string:
madam
madam is a palindrome.

Enter the string:
hello
hello is not a palindrome.
```
